Shine
=====
Shine is a web-based dashboard for indie Mac developers. It's designed to manage payment and order processing with PayPal and generate and email license files to your users using the [Aquatic Prime](http://www.aquaticmac.com/) framework. It even uploads each revision of your app into Amazon S3 and can produce reports from your users' demographic info (gathered via [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/)). It also serves as a central location to collect user feedback, bug reports, and support questions.

This specific GitHub project is a complete rewrite of the previous version that was hosted on Google Code. Normally, I'm not an advocate of rewriting something that works, but in this case I felt it was needed. The original release (two years ago) was written in a very short period of time in a rush to release my first OS X application. This version uses an upgraded version of its PHP framework and is designed with future plans in mind.
